    <p class="m">It's been a little more than a year since the passing of Donald Anthony Stayner. Don started at Athelas on the first day of my internship and over time, he became my product manager, my mentor, and my trusted friend. He was someone who I looked up to and aspired to be like one day. I will never forget the day I got the phone call that he passed away- it came right after he had uncharacteristically missed our Monday sync. I wanted to write this post to share the impact that Don had on me personally.</p>
    <h2 id="don-at-work" class="m"><a class="contrast anch" href="#don-at-work"># </a>don at work</h2>
    <p class="m">I had originally drafted a fairly lengthy section detailing how I was blown away by the Senior PM from Uber, his scrappy way of getting shit done no matter the odds, his attention to detail, and the way he conducted business, but I think his career speaks for itself. He was an incredibly accomplished guy. I've decided to cut all of that and focus on what's really been sitting in my mind- the reason I looked up to Don and felt so much support from him during our time as coworkers. So that's all I'll mention here about Don at work- but make no mistake, anyone will tell you that he was a force of nature. The only thing I'll leave here is- Don was the one who singlehandedly changed my rather close-minded opinion (but sadly very common among SWEs!) from "why would a real productive team ever need a PM" to "a good PM can 10x a team". :]</p>
